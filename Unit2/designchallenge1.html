	<h1>
		Which two websites are you most inspired by?
	</h1>
	<p>
		For my web design portfolio/freelance site, I was inspired by <a href="http://brightbyte.co.uk/" target="_blank">BrightByte Studio</a> and <a href="http://wearecuppa.com/" target="_blank">We Are Cuppa</a>
	</p>
	<h1>
		How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Both similar in their use of a hero image to learn more about their work, with similar visual hierarchy. They both have a great balance in their use of space and size.
	</p>
	<h1>
		What makes them similiar and different?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Personally, I prefer the lightness of We Are Cuppa, but prefer the segmentation of the BrightByte Studio one page scroll. I like when the navigation goes with you as you scroll down the page, like it does on BrightByte Studio, but I believe the compactness of the other site is ok without it.

				<strong>
					Homepage Layout #1
				</strong>
			<br />
				With this layout my work is featured from the very start with a rotating carousel. The navigation here is modeled after We Are Cuppa, with it at the top and the logo in the middle.

				<strong>
					Homepage Layout #2
				</strong>
			<br />
			With this layout the novigation is overlayed on the banner image. The rest of the site is broken down by section and will be a one page scroll, with my work being featured after they learn a little more about me and the services I offer. I personally prefer option #2.
