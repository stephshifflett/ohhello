			<h1>Which two websites are you most inpsired by?</h1>
		<uL>
			<p><strong>Focus Lab LLC</strong></p>
				<p><a href="http://focuslabllc.com/">http://focuslabllc.com/</a></p>
				<p><img src="focuslab.png" width="25%" height="25%"></p>
		<p><strong>Typework</strong></p>
				<p><a href="https://typework.com/">hhttps://typework.com/</a></p>

<p>Naturally you would expect the website of two design & develpment firms to have aesthetically pleasing & usable.</p>
</uL>

<h1>How do they exhibit effective user of space, size, or balance?</h1>
<uL>
<p>Both Focuse Lab & Typework utlize big (size) hero images above the fold to direct the users attention to their value propostion (focal point). With this established hierachy the two design firms effectively communicate who they are and what they do immediately to the user, thus limiting any unnecessary searching to determine what the sites have to offer. </P>

<p> The content of both sites demonstrate the effective user of grouping (positive & negative space) to show relatinoships between imates & images. Also, the white space coupled with a clear hiearchy established by the size of heards & content images allows the user to easily scan the sites for information.</p>
</ul>
			<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
			<ul>
			<p>Typework's log is place top center, while Focus Lab follows convention by placing their logo in the top left corner.</p></ul>


<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>

	<ul><P>Similar to Focus Lab LLC & Typwork I have incorporated a large hero image into tboth of my thumbnail mockups. The purpose is to establish a hierachy of importance, which will allow site vistors to identify what the site is, and my value proposition. Along with establishing hierachy the users attention will be grabed by the large image and text. From there the users will be guided to the content below the hero image. 
	<p><li><strong>Version 1</strong></li></p>
	<img src="version1.png" width="50%" height="50%">
	<p>In <i>version one</i> the positive and negative space will gropu three columns of information. The columns will identify the key knowledge and skill sets that I have to offer. The users attention then will be attracted by a larger image that will separate the about me portion from the content above. 

	<p><li><strong>Version 2</strong></li></p>
	<img src="version2.png" width="50%" height="50%">
	<p>In <i>version two</i> the content below the hero image will showcase my work. The large square boxes will catch the users attention inviting them to click to view more or move from one piece of work to the next. The layout of the work and accompyning descriptive text create a well balanced layout.</p>

</ul>
